# Pac-Man game on a LandTiger board

This is an optional university assignment (called extrapoint) for the 2024/2025 Italian course "Computer Architectures" at Polytechnic University of Turin.

The basic idea is to create a Pac-Man game on a Landtiger board, using the peripherals available on the board and Keil uVision5. 
Each part of the assignment was about the usage of a different aspect of the board. The first part focus has been the usage of the embedded LCD display, timers, joystick and buttons. 
The second part focus has been the usage of the embedded speaker and CAN bus.
